Please add the following course on PrairieLearn in order to access the Post-Readings: CS 105: Introduction to Computing for Non-Tech Majors, Uni High - Fall 2021. In a typical week there will be two zyBooks readings and post readings assigned. The zyBook activities are interleaved with the text and are intended to offer you the opportunity to actively practice the concepts you are reading about. After completing each zyBook activity you will complete an associated post reading activity on PrairieLearn that is intended to garner (1) your thoughts about the chapter, (2) your points of confusion, and (3) how long the activity took you. The third point is especially important early on the first semester as it will allow me to gauge and then scale the future assignment in order to ensure the course has a manageable workload. Adding the Course in zyBooks . | Sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com | Enter zyBook code: UniHighCPAcademicYear2022 | Subscribe | . The cost of the textbook is $33.50. Lecture . Given the reading materials, participation activities, and post-readings are due before lecture. The lectures will be focused on the following: . | Addressing the salient points of each section. | Addressing points of confusion as reported in the muddiest points. | . These two points will be done via in class poll questions. These polls will use ABCD cards which can be downloaded at the following links: . | Apple Version | Android Version | . If you do not wish or are unable to download the app there are paper versions I will happily provide. Any remaining time after the lecture is intended to be used for either homework or reading activities in an effort to further cut down on your homework. You are welcome to work with your peers and seek my assistance. In the event there is a question or set of questions that is causing several people in the class some amount of difficulty I may elect have the class solve it together with my assistance. Additionally, some lectures have been allotted to cover special topics of interest or review days. The former will be treated as a sort of workshop day, half-way between a lecture and a lab. Review days will be used to review topics of interest based on muddiest points. Homework . Please add the following course on PrairieLearn in order to access the homeworks: CS 105: Introduction to Computing for Non-Tech Majors, Uni High - Fall 2021. Homework assignment will be due after all other assignments relating to the topic‚Äôs sections that it covers. These will be completed on PrairieLearn and cover a variety of problem types including: . | True/False | Multiple Choice | Parsons Problems | Code fixing | Programming You are encouraged to work on these problems with your peers either in person on on the class Discord. My schedule outside of office hours can be somewhat turbulent but you are always encouraged to ping me for help if a problem doesn‚Äôt make sense of takes too long. If a problem is taking too long please do not spend undue time on it, rather, complete which problems you can and come to office hours to go over the rest. | . Challenge Activities . The challenge activities are assigned at the beginning of the week and are due the following Sunday. These are some of the more difficult problems in the course so I encourage you to get an early start and complete those which you can during the weeks participation readings. Those which you do not complete during the week can be completed on the weekends. I am available on Discord during the weekend so feel free to ping me with any of your confusions . Labs . The labs in this course will take place on Anchor days and offer you a chance to exercise the material in a more traditional setting. Early on in the semester we will cover the basics of the Git version control system as well as some more straightforward lab both using a local editor and Python interpreter as well as Google Collaboratory. For the labs please download one of the following editors, or any other editor of your choice, to your machine: . | VScode | Atom | vim | sublime 3 | GNU Emacs | . Additionally, please ensure the latest version of Python is installed to your machine: Python 3.9.x. ",
