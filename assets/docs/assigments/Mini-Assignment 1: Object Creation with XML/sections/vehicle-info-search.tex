This class will only have the \lstinline|main| method and will structure the
search functionality of the database. It should be implemented using the
following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate a database using the provided XML file.
    \item Present the user with the list of available makes, ask them which they want, and store that input.
    \item Use the make they selected to query which classes of vehicle are available with that make, present the result, then ask the user which they want.
    \item User the previous make and class results to query which models are available, present the results of that query, and ask the user which they would prefer.
    \item User the user input from the previous step to query the list of all those models, iterate over that list, and print each vehicle object to the user.
    \item Ask the user if they want to continue. If they type \lstinline|q| terminate the loop; otherwise, continue.
\end{enumerate}
Your output, once finished, should look something like this:

\begin{shell}
Generating database...
Makes: [AM General, ASC Incorporated, Acura, Alfa Romeo, American Motors Corporation, Aston Martin, Audi, ...]
Enter a make: Audi
Classes: [Compact Cars, Large Cars, Midsize Cars, Midsize Station Wagons, Midsize-Large Station Wagons, ...]
Enter a class: Midsize Cars
Models: [100, 100 quattro, 200, 200 quattro, 200 quattro 20v, 5000 CS Turbo, 5000 CS quattro, ...]
Enter a model: 100

RESULTS:
--1993 Audi 100--
Cyliners: 6
Drive: Front-Wheel Drive
Fuel Type: Premium
Transmission: Automatic 4-spd
Class :Midsize Cars

--1993 Audi 100--
Cyliners: 6
Drive: Front-Wheel Drive
Fuel Type: Premium
Transmission: Manual 5-spd
Class :Midsize Cars

--1994 Audi 100--
Cyliners: 6
Drive: Front-Wheel Drive
Fuel Type: Premium
Transmission: Automatic 4-spd
Class :Compact Cars
...
\end{shell}

Do note that the above example has replace some of the output for makes,
classes, and models with ellipses. This is only to shorted the example. Your
code should output each of the lists in their entirety.
