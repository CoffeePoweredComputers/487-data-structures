The second case, where the node we want to remove has a right or left subtree,
is still relatively straight forward. As with the first step we begin by
finding the node we want to remove and it's parent
(Figure~\ref{fig:onesubtree-1}).  We then take the right pointer of the parent
and short-circut the tree by updating it to point to root of the node we want 
to remove's existing subtree (Figure~\ref{fig:onesubtree-2}). Now, at this point
the node is no longer reachable but it is still attached to the graph. In order
to totally remove it we must set the reference from the node we want to remove
to the root of it's subtree equal to \lstinline|null| (Figure~\ref{fig:onesubtree-3}).
